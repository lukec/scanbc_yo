Rewrite @ScanBC tweets to feature our friend, @GoldfishYO.

This script runs in a docker container.  You are required to mount a config file that contains twitter login credentials and will keep state of which tweets have been sent.

The config file should be mounted at `/opt/scanbc_yo/etc/config.yaml`.  It should look like this:

    ---
    screen_name: scanbc
    twitter_access_secret: aoeu
    twitter_access_token: aoeu
    twitter_consumer_key: aoeu
    twitter_consumer_secret: aoeu


Start it like so:

  docker run -v `pwd`/etc:/opt/scanbc_yo/etc --name scanbc_yo scanbc_yo
